# OSG User School 2020

<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Could you transform your research with vast amounts of computing?</p>

*Come spend a week at the beautiful University of Wisconsin–Madison and learn how.*

During the school, July 6–10, you will learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems — at your own campus or
using the national Open Science Grid (OSG) — to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today’s
cutting-edge science.  Through lectures, discussions, and **lots of hands-on activities** with experienced OSG staff,
you will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific
computing workflow, and where to turn for more information and help.  Take a look at [the high-level curriculum and
syllabus](/curriculum/overview.md) for more details.

The school is ideal for graduate students in any science or research domain where large-scale computing is a vital part
of the research process, plus we will consider applications from advanced undergraduates, post-doctoral students,
faculty, and staff.  Students accepted to this program will receive financial support for basic travel and local costs
associated with the School.

## Applications

Applications are open now.

<span style="color: #FF6600;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Due to the COVID-19 pandemic,</span> the application
deadline has been extended to Friday, April 10.</span> If you are unsure about applying, given all the uncertainties
lately, go ahead and submit an application!  Even if this year’s School is postponed or canceled, the first choice of
seats at the next School that is offered will go to applicants selected this year.

To apply, complete both of the steps below (in parallel, if you like):

* Complete the [online application form](https://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/osgus-2020/) (link goes to vdt.cs.wisc.edu website,
  which hosts the application)

* Have someone email a letter of recommendation for you to
  [user-school@opensciencegrid.org](mailto:user-school@opensciencegrid.org)
  (any reasonable format is fine; we like PDF or plain text best)

For the letter of recommendation, ask someone who knows you professionally&nbsp;&mdash; ideally a faculty member or
other supervisor.  They should clearly identify your name and the “OSG User School 2020” in the subject line and letter,
so that we can associate your application and letter.

Ideal candidates will:

* Be graduate students doing research or support staff helping researchers (but see below)
* Need large amounts of computing, which could transform research or open new paths to discovery
* Have basic experience with the Linux command line (or learn beforehand)
* Be available to travel to Madison for the School dates (foreign students, check your passport and visa now!)

**Not a graduate student or support staff?** We consider applications from advanced undergraduates, especially those who
are involved in graduate-level research or coursework; make a strong case for yourself!  Also, we consider other groups
(post-doctoral students, faculty, researchers, other staff, etc.), especially if you convince us that this opportunity
is likely to have a significant effect on your work or research, or that of others.

## Spread the Word

Please tell people who may be interested in the School about us.  We will announce the School by email a couple of
times, but you can send anyone to this website at any time!

Another way to help: [Download our flyer](/files/osg-user-school-2020-flyer.pdf), print copies, and post in prominent
locations where good candidates might see it!

# OSG User School 2020

<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Could you transform your research with vast amounts of computing?</p>

*Come spend a week at the beautiful University of Wisconsin–Madison and learn how.*

During the school, July 6–10, you will learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems — at your own campus or
using the national Open Science Grid (OSG) — to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today’s
cutting-edge science.  Through lectures, discussions, and **lots of hands-on activities** with experienced OSG staff,
you will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific
computing workflow, and where to turn for more information and help.  Take a look at [the high-level curriculum and
syllabus](/curriculum/overview.md) for more details.

The school is ideal for graduate students in any science or research domain where large-scale computing is a vital part
of the research process, plus we will consider applications from advanced undergraduates, post-doctoral students,
faculty, and staff.  Students accepted to this program will receive financial support for basic travel and local costs
associated with the School.

## Applications

Applications are now closed.  We received many applications this year, so thanks to everyone for your enthusiastic
interest especially during these highly unusual times!

If still needed, have someone email a letter of recommendation for you to
[user-school@opensciencegrid.org](mailto:user-school@opensciencegrid.org) (any reasonable format is fine; we like PDF or
plain text best).  Ask someone who knows you professionally&nbsp;&mdash; ideally a faculty member or other supervisor.
They should clearly identify your name and the &ldquo;OSG User School 2020&rdquo; in the subject line and letter, so
that we can associate your application and letter.

We plan to review applications by late April and inform applicants of their status by early May or so.  At that time, we
will also have clear information about any changes to the School due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  We will contact all
applicants once decisions have been made.  Thank you for your patience!
